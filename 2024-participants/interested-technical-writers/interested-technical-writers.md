# Directory Instructions

To add your information to the [interested technical writers](./interested-technical-writers.md) directory: 

1. Create a Markdown file with three pieces of information: your name, a link to your portfolio, personal site, résumé, or CV, and an indication of your interests. 
   
Use [this format](./EXAMPLE.md): 

 `Jane Doe | [Portfolio](https://janedoe.example.com) | Skilled in API documentation, writing tutorials`

If you have more than one link, use this format: 

 `Jane Doe | [Portfolio](https://janedoe.example.com), [résumé](https://janedoe.example.com/resume) | Skilled in API documentation, writing tutorials`

2. Save your Markdown file as YOURNAME.md.

3. [Create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to add your file to the [interested-technical-writers](./interested-technical-writers) directory.

We will concatenate the files into a table and display it on the [interested technical writers](./interested-technical-writers.md) page, beginning Monday, February 19. Pull requests will be accepted until the end of the 2024 technical writer hiring period (May 22, 2024).

**If your Markdown file is not valid, it will not be included in the directory.**
